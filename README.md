# HarvardX_Capstone_MovieLens_R
Data Science Capstone - HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science - MovieLens Project

For this project, I created a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. You can find the entire latest MovieLens dataset at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/. 

I used the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.
